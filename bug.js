In React Native, a less common error arises when using AsyncStorage with large amounts of data.  If you try to store a JSON object exceeding a certain size limit (which varies based on device and OS), AsyncStorage might fail silently, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The error might not manifest as a clear error message, making it tricky to debug. This is because the AsyncStorage's underlying implementation has limitations in handling excessively large data chunks.
